# Super-Pong
C++ and SFML sports game.

Introduction:

After finishing my text game Word Fighter I wanted to make game with graphics.
So I started to learn SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).
This is my first bigger game with normal graphics. 

About game:

It's sports game based on the first computer game in the world "Pong".
You can play alone with AI or with friend in 2 players mode. There are 7 characters in the game that you can play.
